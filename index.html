                    <p>Hi! My name is Elijah Nance. I am 23 years old and am from Mooresville, NC. I served five years in the United States Marine Corps as an Infantry Rifleman. I was deployed twice and have gotten to see a lot of the world because of it! When I'm not in school I am normally either at the gym or bartending. My hobbies include gaming, going to breweries, and watching sports with my friends.</p>

                    <p>I decided to pursure web devolopment because of a growing fascination with technology/computers and my father has been in the industry for a long time. Through him I've been able to see a lot of what the day-to-day looks like and am very excited to begin my journey in the field!</p>
